            the market strives to bring both quality and value to it’s customers.
            The market uses only Boar’s Head Brand meats and cheeses, the freshest produce, and locally baked bread in making its sandwiches.
            Salads and soups are made fresh daily in our kitchen.
            The market also offers fresh baked breakfast fare, such as, muffins, scones, cinnamon swirls,
            and a full menu of coffee and espresso drinks.
            On your way home from work, you can stop by the store and pick up fresh cut steaks, chicken, and pork for dinner.
